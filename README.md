# cdepl: A collection of scripts to simplify deployment of distributed applications
cdepl is a collection of scripts creating a framework to simplify deployment of
distributed applications to different (Linux) cluster setups. It creates an 
abstraction layer to the target cluster system for the application to deploy. 
This enables clear separation of the actual hardware to deploy to and the 
application getting deployed.

Different cluster (type) implementations map to specific cluster setups with
their dedicated environments. For example, the *localhost* type maps the 
abstraction layer to your current machine for quick testing or simple debugging 
tasks. If you use the *simple* cluster type, you can deploy to an arbitrary
cluster setup by providing a list of hostnames. Further types handle
environment specific features for each cluster system.

Applications are implemented in separate modules as well. With every application
offering different features and requiring different ways to control it, there
is no unified abstraction layer for them.
However, creating abstractions of tasks like "start app X on node 0" or 
"wait until app startup on node 0 finished" makes it easier to write small
and powerful deploy scripts.

# Features
* Fully bash scripted, using common Linux utilities (no further dependencies, 
not counting the application)
* Cluster abstraction layer supporting different cluster types
* Application abstraction layer to simplify common deployment tasks for the
target application
* Extensible: Write your own cluster or application modules
* Run and kill scripts: Just a bash script with a simple framework to create
simple "commands" to manage deployments

# Setup/Requirements
You can run the deployment either on a node of your cluster or even on your
development machine that has access to the cluster. SSH is used for 
communication and requires passwordless auth to all cluster nodes from your
source machine. Furthermore, the currently implemented cluster types expect
you to have your folder containing your application data as well as the
output folder mounted on all cluster nodes (e.g. nfs).

Bash 4.x is required. All commands used are already installed on common Linux 
distributions.

# Deployment
The root script *cdepl* spawns an interactive shell to execute various commands.
You have to specify the type of cluster when running it, e.g. 
```
./cdepl localhost
```

If you run this the fist time and depending on the cluster type, you get errors
about missing configuration values. Create a configuration file next to the
root cdepl script called ".cdepl_XXX" where XXX is replaced with the cluster
type, e.g. ".cdepl_localhost". Just add the missing key-value tuples similar
to a standard properties file, e.g.
```
user=clusterUser100
```

Use the 'help' command to get information about available commands.

Example, let's allocate some nodes and run DXRAM on them:
```
./cdepl hhubs
cdepl> cluster alloc 2
cdepl> cluster status
cdepl> cluster nodes
cdepl> run dxram --superpeers 1 --peers 1 --storage 1024 --handler 2 --print-logs
cdepl> kill dxram
cdepl> kill zookeeper
```

| `--superpeers`                     | `--peers`                    | `--storage`                                                         | `--handler`                           | `--print-logs`                           | `--terminal`                                             |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| The amount of superpeers to deploy | The amount of peers to deploy | The amount of megabytes each peer allocates for its key-value store | The amount of message handler threads | Prints and follows logs after deployment | Starts the terminal server application on the first peer |

If you re-run the above commands often, you can also put them into a text file
and feed that to cdepl instead of using the interactive shell:
```
touch my_cmds
echo "cluster alloc 2" >> my_cmds
echo "cluster status" >> my_cmds
echo "cluster nodes" >> my_cmds
echo "run dxram --superpeers 1 --peers 1 --storage 1024 --handler 2 --print-logs" >> my_cmds
echo "kill dxram" >> my_cmds
./cdepl hhubs ./my_cmds
```

# Writing your own deploy scripts
The *examples/null.cdepl* script is a bare skeleton to get started. It provides
all functions (with documentation) that are required by the framework. To get
an idea of how the deployment is executed, checkout the documented examples.
The examples also include all necessary steps that you have to apply to your
own script, too.

# Cluster modules
If you have a cluster setup that does not match or work with any of the 
currently implemented modules, you can implement your own. Take a look at
existing modules (e.g. localhost) to get an idea which functions must be 
implemented. Tt's very likely that you can copy/paste code of the already 
implemented functions and solved problems.

# Application modules
Application modules do not have to implement a common abstraction layer. 
However, they should provide easy to use functions abstracting common tasks 
necessary for your application deployment, e.g. starting, waiting, shutdown,
error checking, ...
Take a look at the already implemented modules to get an idea of how these
tasks are abstracted.
